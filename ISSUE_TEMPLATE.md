# Thank you for your interest in my project. Please note the following before creating an issue
##	This was a school project, and probably wont be updated after the due date, therefore, making an issue past 2018 June will probably never be fixed.
##	I am fairly new to JavaScript and CSS, so any little flaws or imperfections in my code are not intentional
##	If you can, please attempt to leave a suggestion and a small, brief explanation of why your suggestion is better (Alternatively, make a Pull Request).
